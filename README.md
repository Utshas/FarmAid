# FarmAid
This project was a group project developed to participate in NATIONAL HACKATHON, BANGLADESH-2016. Here we have tried to solve a lot of problems of our farmers. Our features were:
1. Farmers could see the nearest dealers and they could get the actual information about market price, so they could buy and sell things in acurate rate.
2. Our app could detect the deseases of crops by detecting it's color.
3. They could also learn about the modern cultivation method from this project.
4. Many of the farmers are illiterate here and unable to understand english. So, we designed this app on bengali and also we gave them one more support that will read all the menus for them in bengali so that they can easily understand.
